ISSUES NOT ADHERING TO THESE RULES WILL BE CLOSED
If you want your issue addressed, please stick to the rules

Please read the documentation before raising an issue
- [Configuration](http://www.wheresrhys.co.uk/fetch-mock/#usageconfiguration)
- [API](http://www.wheresrhys.co.uk/fetch-mock/#api-mockingmock)
- [Troubleshooting](http://www.wheresrhys.co.uk/fetch-mock/#troubleshootingtroubleshooting)

If your issue is about types being out of date please submit a PR. 
I'm happy to include types in this library, but I am not a typescript user
but am not prepared to invest my time writing them.

Be clear and precise about what the issue is. Take the time to include details of
what's wrong, including the version of fetch-mock you're using and which environment
it's running in.
- Bad: 'It doesn't work', 'It conflicts with x', 'I get an error'
- Good: 'When using webpack 4 and babel 7 I get an `Error: undefined array at line 191`
  during compilation'

Provide code that recreates the issue you're having. Ideally either
- recreate the problem with a failing test and submit a PR
- recreate the problem in a code sharing platform, e.g. [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/nodejs)
- create a repo with a minimal test case using your build/test setup, and 
  link to this in the issue

The above may seem like a lot of work, but the easier you make it for me to 
recreate the bug, the sooner it'll get fixed.
