  v7, v8 & v9 are practically identical, only differing in their treatment of a few edge cases, or in compatibility with other libraries and environments. For clarity, each section of the documentation tells you which version a feature was added with a <small class="version-added">version</small> label.

  For previous versions follow the documentation below:
