  fetch-mock requires the following to run:

  - [Node.js](https://Node.js.org/) 8+ for full feature operation
  - [Node.js](https://Node.js.org/) 0.12+ with [limitations](http://www.wheresrhys.co.uk/fetch-mock/installation)
  - [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm) (normally comes with Node.js)
  - Either
    - [node-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch) when testing in Node.js. To allow users a choice over which version to use, `node-fetch` is not included as a dependency of `fetch-mock`.
    - A browser that supports the `fetch` API either natively or via a [polyfill/ponyfill](https://ponyfoo.com/articles/polyfills-or-ponyfills)
